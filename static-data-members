Static data members are associated with class and not with object. Static data members exist even if there is no object of the class
No matter how many objects are created for a class, there will be only one static data member

class MyClass {
  static int x;   // declaration
}
.
.
.
.
.
int MyClass::x = 15; // definition

Static member function - 
It cannot have a this pointer as it is not related to any object
As a result, it cannot access non-static data members/ non-static member functions as they are part of any particular object.

Singleton class - A class is called singleton if it can have only one instance
